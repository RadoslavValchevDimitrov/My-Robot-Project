#Robot on Mars

In this project I have provided the implementation of a robot that collects rocks on Mars. The robot has only
2 functions available:

* For one day to collect one stone
* In a day to clone

Since both operations take a full day, the robot cannot clone itself and collect stones in the same day.

In RobotOperations class  I have implemented an algorithm that converts a number of days into an action plan 
and algorithm that is the inverse of previous and converts a number of stones into an action plan.

Providing  two unit tests to prove the correctness of the two methods in RobotOpearations.

In the Rest package I have implemented two methods that exposes the functionality of RobotOpearations.
